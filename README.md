# PRODIGY_DS_02
# Overview
PRODIGY_DS_Task2 is a Python script that demonstrates the use of Pandas and Matplotlib libraries for conducting data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The script is designed to work with a dataset stored in a CSV file, handling missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and generating various visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.

# Features
Data Loading: The script loads a dataset from a CSV file using Pandas, allowing easy access to the data for analysis.

Missing Values Handling: Missing values within the dataset are handled appropriately, ensuring accurate analysis by either imputing missing values or dropping them as necessary.

Column Selection: Unnecessary columns are dropped to focus the analysis on relevant variables, streamlining the EDA process.

Survival Rate Analysis: The script conducts an overall analysis of survival rates among passengers, providing insights into the likelihood of survival based on available data.

Variable Breakdown Analysis: It further breaks down survival rates by variables such as passenger class and gender, allowing for a deeper understanding of how these factors influence survival chances.

Visualization: Matplotlib is used to generate visualizations such as histograms and bar charts to illustrate distributions and relationships within the data effectively.

Age and Fare Distributions: The script specifically visualizes the age and fare distributions of passengers, providing insights into the demographics and economic backgrounds of individuals onboard.

# DataSet
The script is designed to work with any dataset in xlsx format. However, it's particularly suited for datasets containing information about passengers, such as the famous Titanic dataset, which includes details about passengers such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and survival status.
